Customer Churn Analysis

Overview:

Built a robust system to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The project uncovered critical findings and model performance scores:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1-Conducted in-depth analysis of the customer churn dataset.

2-Notable Finding: Customers with shorter contract durations and high monthly charges were more likely to churn.

3-Identified relevant features and patterns influencing customer retention.

4-Visualized trends through various plots and graphs.

Model Development:

1-Implemented a Decision Tree classifier and boosted models (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting) for accurate churn predictions.

2-Noteworthy Result: AdaBoost achieved the highest F1 score of 0.78, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.

3-Analyzed feature importance to understand factors influencing customer churn.

4-Visualized results and insights for easy interpretation.
